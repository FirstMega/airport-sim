## Guidelines

1. Keep the code modular, the project is structured such that it forces you to keep it modular. Since the tasks are divided b/w groups, modularity is necessary to put the whole program together.
2. Create a folder in the `modules` directory with your team number and module name. _Eg: If you are working on check in, and your team number is 3, make a folder named `3-checkin`_.
